# A Basic Custom Homepage For Browser. 

This is a basic custom homepage for a browser. I made it using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can edit it to change the name, etc. I have used some live wallpapers and created a simple method to get a random background video. I also used an API to show a quote.
